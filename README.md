# 📏 Object Measurement App (Computer Vision)

Measure real-world object dimensions using **OpenCV** and a webcam.  
This project calibrates the camera with a known reference object (like a credit card or A4 paper) and then estimates the width and height of other objects in **centimeters**.

---

## ✨ Features
- Detects objects with computer vision (OpenCV).
- Measures **width & height in cm** after calibration.
- Works with common objects: pens, books, mouse, etc.
- Simple webcam-based measurement — no ArUco markers required.
